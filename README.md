# Predictive Analysis using scikit-learn

## Project Overview
This project completes the IS 362 predictive analysis assignment using scikit-learn. The goal is to determine which predictor (odor or cap color) most accurately predicts whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.

## Key Features

### Data Preprocessing
- ✅ Uses preprocessed data from previous assignment
- ✅ Converts categorical variables to dummy variables using `pandas.get_dummies()`
- ✅ Creates three feature sets: Odor only, Cap Color only, Combined

### Machine Learning Models
- ✅ **Logistic Regression**: Linear classification model
- ✅ **Decision Tree**: Non-linear tree-based model  
- ✅ **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for improved accuracy

### Model Evaluation
- ✅ Accuracy scoring for all models
- ✅ Cross-validation for robustness testing
- ✅ Confusion matrices and classification reports
- ✅ Feature importance analysis
- ✅ ROC curves for probability-based models
